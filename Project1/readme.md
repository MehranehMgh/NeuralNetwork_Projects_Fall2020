Implementing a simple Neural Network on a bank problem dataset

The problem:
A bank has noticed that a large number of its customers are leaving. After gathering information about the individuals who have left the bank, along with some other active customers, the bank intends to predict which customers are likely to leave in the future.

Different structures were used with varying scaling, regularization, number of layers, and so on.
